 The 3 pillars are : 
 1. CNM
 2. Libnetwork
 3. Drivers
 
 CNM: 
 Libnetwork and drivers are derived from CNM.
 CNM doesnt fit for k8s. So k8s use CNI.
 CNM defines 3 major : sandbox, endpoint , network
 \\ Sandbox is named as namespace in linux. Isolated area of OS. COntains full n/wk stack.
 \\Endpoint : Network interface , e.g. eth0
 \\Network : Connected endpoints.
 
 LIBNETWORK:
 Real world implementation of CNM by Docker.
 Written in Golang code
 Cross-platform 
 Lives on github also
 
 Socketplane helped docker in networking efficiency.
 
 Drivers: Network-specific details.
    - Overlay
    - MACVLAN
    - IPVLAN
    - Bridge
   THere are drivers which are local and remote . 
   Local = "natives"
   Remote = "3rd party"
   
   Provides Distributed KV store.
   Network gossips.
   Encryption
   Service discovery
   IP address management.
    
 Local - Single host
 Swarm = Multi-host
 
 $ docker network ls  # shows all the network and types present and running.
 $ docker network inspect  #
 
 In windows docker use nat network whereas for linux it use docker0
 
 Other commands for docker are: 
 connect, create, disconnect, inspect, ls, prune, rm.
