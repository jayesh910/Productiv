In each node(host) docker has created sandbox which enables bridge0 on each node.
Then VXLAN Tunnel is bought up which is connected between nodes.
VXLAN tunnel = OVERLAY network which gives one IP to manage all. e.g. 10.0.0.0/16


Make sure these ports are open on both the nodes:
  1. 2789/udp
  2. 7946/tcp/udp
  3. 2377/tcp
Install swarm on both nodes : 
 From node1 : $ docker swarm init
 # it will give you the join token to run on node 2 to make it as worker.
 
To see the nodes:
$ docker node ls

$ docker network ls

1. docker_gwbridge: Is the local bridge to work with containers 
2. ingress : overlay network for swarm load balancing.

To create own overlay:
$ docker network create -d overlay ps-over

But you cant see this network ps-over on node 2 until you have deployed container 
So to deploy container: 

$docker service create --name ps-svc --network ps-over --replicas 2 alpine sleep 1d

Now you can see the two containers running on two different nodes.
