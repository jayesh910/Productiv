2 types of Storages:
1. Ephemeral : Same lifetime as a pod
2. Durable:  Beyond pods lifetime

a. EmptyDir: Creates empty directory when created & assigned to pod
   Stays as long as pod is running
   once pod is deleted , emptydir is deleted forever
   
 Use Case: Temporary space
 
b. hostPath: mounts a file or directory from the host node's filesystem into your pod,
   Remains even after the pod is terminated
   similar to docker volume
   Use cautiously when required 
   Host issues might cause problem to hostpath
 Use Case: in case of NFS & not for host OS 
 
c. gcePersistentDisk
   mount volume into pod
   Volume is persisted even after pods termination
   Read-only  can be attached to multiple pods
   Read-Write only on single node at a time
   
   Restrictions:
   Must create PD using gcloud or the GCE API 
   Nodes on which pods are running must be GCP VM's
