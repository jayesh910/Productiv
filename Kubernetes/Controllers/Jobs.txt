Run tasks till completion or
at scheduled time like taking backup of database everyday.
JOBS 

jOBS is a controller which defines task to be completed.
JOBS is specially used for batch processing .

 2 types of Jobs are present: 

	1. run to completion (Jobs)[When task is executed completely the job will shut down by itself][Controller will get the exit code 0 when task is done.][We have to shut the pods manually.]
	2. Scheduled (CronJob)[Purpose is to basically delete all the logs and clear space.]

1. Run to completion
	-Each job creates one or more pods.
	-Ensures they are successfully terminated.
	-Job controller restarts or rescheduled if a pod or node fails during execution.
	-You are responsible to handle the pods .
	-Can run multiple pods in parallel.
USE CASES:
	-One time initialization of resources 
	-Multiple workers to process messages in queue.
