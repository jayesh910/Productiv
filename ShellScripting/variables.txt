Write #!/bin/bash
Variable mean to give data to something

name=jayesh   #No spaces to be placed.
echo name
echo $name    #To tell any variable value , use $
Best practice is to mention variable as in the bracket : ${name}

number=10
number=$(expr $number + 1)    #expr tells that it is  variable & put space in between.

Variables don't have data types
All variables start with $ when being referenced
When setting the variable , dont use $ sign
